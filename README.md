# Deck of Cards Application
This application models a standard 52-card deck and includes several key features.

- **Shuffle Method**: implements a method to shuffle the deck, ensuring random order of the cards.
- **Filter by Suit**: retrieves all cards of a specific suit from the shuffled deck.

  - Spades (Ace to King)
- **Unicode Representation**: the output uses Unicode characters for the card suits (♦, ♣, ♥, ♠), making the display more visually accurate and engaging.
